Off into the space,
exploring the Saturn's ring,
and on the way back home,
got a singal from our neighbourly red planet.
Have to choose your path,
with low supplements to barely last,
to live wondering or die exploring.

## Flutter Feb Day 2 Session in brief :
* Asset Accumulation
* First Screen
* Making the Button Work
* Navigator.push
* Make the second screen
* Make a dummy route to see the second screen
* Make a route generator that uses enum to generate properly configured routes
* Make the last screens and complete the game with Navigator.pop()

# Brief description of what we did :
* At first we gathered required images and uploaded it in pubspec.yaml
* Then we assigned certain strings and constans to build up our story line 
* We then worked on our main.dart screen creating the framework required followed by making our first screen, buttons,
  second screen and dummy routes to all the screens
* Finally we created route generator by using enum to generate routes and then removing dummy routes and
  assigning the final routes to various screens
* At last we created the final pages those being end pages of our app and complete the game by assigning Navigator.pop to the end screens.
